# NFT Turn based game - Smart Contract

This a front-end site for a turn based game where the goal is to beat a Boss called Nagativo by sending him good vibes :-). Users mint an NFT player Character from 9 character types then proceed to the Arena to challenge Negativo. Each hit by the playing character is reciprocated by a hit from the Boss. A player has the ability to heal other players who may have created a playing character as well.

The game is currently connecting to an already deployed contract on the Ethereum Rinkeby blockchain. 
If you wish to use it yourself, you can change the contract adress in the file src/constants.jsx. Remeber to copy and past the ABI file in src/utils/MyEpicGame.json
